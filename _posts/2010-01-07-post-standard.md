## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a single registry, agreed and distributed in several nodes of a network

Each block stores:
- a number of valid records or transactions
- information regarding that block
- its linking with the previous block and the following block through the hash of each block - a unique code that would be like the block's fingerprint.
